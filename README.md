### Description
The code in this repository is used to perform data analysis on a dataset of patient samples, with variables like patient demographics, SNPs, and statin metabolite levels in plasma, as well as COBAS measurements of protein levels in plasma.  

The actual data isn't included in this repository as the data is sensitive in nature. The code is uploaded to:  
1. Facilitate my own version control of the code  
2. Document the work done to date

### Contents
The R files are split by the function. While most of the code can be found in the .Rmd files, these stand alone scripts are included to be used when running analysis different from what is done in the notebooks.  

The .Rmd files are used to answer specific questions, or present the data analysis in a coherent flow.  

The app.R file is a shiny app that facilitates quick visualisation of the data, primarily for EDA or QC.
